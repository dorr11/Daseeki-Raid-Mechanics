# Changelog

## 1.3.0
- Settings rebuilt on the new Daseeki Core 2.0 interface (requires Daseeki Core 2.0.0+).
  The boss / mechanic / detail drill-down is preserved; detail editor groups now stack
  and collapse cleanly with no overlap.

## 1.2.1
- Curated special-warning and voice-countdown flag assignments across encounters.

## 1.2.0
- Naxxramas encounter data verified against captured combat logs (DBM-parity pass):
  corrected spell IDs, Loatheb heal-window redesign, Faerlina/Sapphiron trigger fixes,
  Berserk timers, Thaddius add-phase, and more.
- Added Blackwing Lair and Temple of Ahn'Qiraj encounter data.
- Phase E: special warnings, voice countdowns, pull timer, and kill stats.
- Debug-only banner fade and debug-log hygiene improvements.
## 1.1.0
- Added a combat-log debug/timing harness for verifying real boss mechanic timings:
  casts (with the interval since a spell last fired), auras, damage taken, and deaths
  are captured to a persisted, per-sitting debug log (viewable in-game and clearable).
- Added a "Debug Only" mode — a blanket kill-switch that silences ALL mechanic output
  (Ability Tracker, On Cast / Personal Damage notifications, custom widgets, boss-death
  sound) while combat-log data keeps being captured, so real fights can be used to
  gather accurate timings without the addon's current guesses firing alongside.
- Added a persistent login reminder and an on-screen indicator while Debug Only is on,
  so alerts are never left silently disabled.
- Added an optional DBM cross-log bridge: when DBM-Core is installed, DBM's own timers,
  announces, stage changes, and pull detection are logged alongside our raw capture for
  side-by-side comparison. Fully optional and degrades cleanly when DBM is absent.
- Added hard caps on debug-log SavedVariables growth (live-log line cap with oldest-line
  trimming, plus a capped ring-buffer of saved sessions) to prevent logout/reload lag.
- Added a "Clear Saved Sessions" button to the options panel, and `/drm` debug commands
  (debug, debugonly, log, savelog, clearlog, clearsessions).

## 1.0.0
- Initial CurseForge release.
